# Technical Specification for AI-Fitness Application Development Using Anthropic Claude

Based on the previous analysis of the comprehensive wellness application concept, this document provides a detailed project launch plan using modern AI technologies. This specification contains concrete steps for initiating development, including environment setup, project structure, and Anthropic Claude API integration.

## Phase 1: Development Environment Setup

### Anthropic Claude API Configuration

The first step requires obtaining access to the Anthropic Claude API. For Russian developers, using a VPN and Gmail registration is recommended. The API key acquisition process includes the following steps:

1. Registration on the console.anthropic.com platform with VPN
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in account settings
3. Create a new key specifying the project name
4. Securely store the API key for future use

### Python SDK Installation

Working with the Claude API requires installing the official Python library:

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

Basic connection setup looks as follows:

```python
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    api_key=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
)

message = client.messages.create(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Create a Pilates workout plan"
        }
    ],
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
)
```


### Virtual Environment Creation

To isolate project dependencies, create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv fitness_ai_env
# Activation on Windows
fitness_ai_env\Scripts\activate
# Activation on Linux/Mac
source fitness_ai_env/bin/activate
```


## Phase 2: Project Architecture

### Directory Structure

Recommended project structure based on microservices architecture:

```
fitness-ai-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── apps/
│   │   ├── users/          # User management
│   │   ├── workouts/       # Workouts and exercises

```


### Technology Stack Selection

**Backend Technologies:**

- Django REST Framework for API development
- PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Docker for containerization

**Mobile Technologies:**
React Native shows advantages for rapid MVP development due to the ability to leverage existing JavaScript expertise. The framework provides cross-platform development and rapid iteration capabilities.

**AI Technologies:**

- Anthropic Claude for personalized content generation
- Runway Gen-4 or Sora for video generation
- Three.js for 3D avatars


## Phase 3: MVP Functionality

### Priority Features for First Release

Following MVP development methodology, focus on key features:

**Big Bets (Critical Features):**

- User registration and profile with questionnaire
- AI-powered personalized workout generator via Claude API
- Basic avatar system for each day of the week
- Medical data encryption for users

**Quick Wins (Rapidly Implementable):**

- Calorie counter and basic metrics
- Basic music library
- Workout notification system
- Dark theme interface


### VRM Avatar Integration

For creating 7 virtual avatars, using the VRM format is recommended. The technology provides a standardized 3D model structure for web platforms. Integration is achieved through the @pixiv/three-vrm library in the React Native application.

## Phase 4: Containerization and Deployment

### Docker Configuration

Docker is used to ensure consistent deployment. Basic Dockerfile for Django application:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "core.wsgi:application"]
```


### Docker Compose for Development

The docker-compose.yml file combines all services:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: fitness_ai
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine

  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    environment:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```


## Phase 5: Security and Compliance

### Medical Data Encryption

The system must provide HIPAA-compliant encryption for medical analyses. Using AES-256 for data at rest encryption and TLS 1.3 for data transmission is recommended.

### API Key Management

All API keys should be stored in environment variables and never committed to version control. Use python-dotenv for configuration management:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
RUNWAY_API_KEY = os.getenv('RUNWAY_API_KEY')
```


## Phase 6: Alternative LLM Solutions

### Recommended Models Besides Anthropic

To ensure fault tolerance, integration with multiple AI providers is recommended:

1. **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** - shows 63.8% accuracy in SWE-Bench tests
2. **DeepSeek-R1** - 87.3% accuracy in medical applications
3. **OpenAI GPT-4** - for video generation via Sora API

### Fallback System

Implementing a switching system between AI providers ensures continuous operation:

```python
class AIContentGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = [
            AnthropicProvider(),
            GeminiProvider(),
            OpenAIProvider()
        ]
    
    def generate_workout(self, user_profile):
        for provider in self.providers:
            try:
                return provider.generate_content(user_profile)
            except Exception as e:
                continue
        raise Exception("All AI providers are unavailable")
```


## Phase 7: First 30 Days Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundation Setup

- Repository creation and basic project structure
- Docker development environment setup
- Anthropic Claude API integration
- Basic user model creation


### Week 3-4: Core Functionality

- Personalized workout system development
- VRM avatar integration via Three.js
- Basic mobile version on React Native
- Medical data encryption system


### Further Development

After successful MVP, subsequent iterations should include video generation integration, expanded avatar system, and corporate features for business scaling.

This plan provides a structured approach to developing an innovative AI-fitness application using modern technologies and industry best practices.

## Key Considerations for Anthropic Integration

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- Structure prompts with clear context about user goals, physical condition, and preferences
- Include specific parameters like workout duration, intensity level, and equipment availability
- Use role-based prompting to position Claude as a certified fitness instructor
- Implement few-shot learning examples for consistent workout format generation


### API Rate Limiting and Cost Management

- Implement request batching to optimize API usage
- Cache frequently requested workout types to reduce API calls
- Monitor token usage to control operational costs
- Implement progressive enhancement: basic workouts cached, personalized content via API


### Content Quality Assurance

- Validate AI-generated workouts against fitness safety guidelines
- Implement feedback loops to improve prompt effectiveness
- A/B test different prompt variations for optimal results
- Ensure medical disclaimer compliance for all generated content

This comprehensive technical specification provides Anthropic with clear context and implementation guidelines for supporting the AI-fitness application development project.
